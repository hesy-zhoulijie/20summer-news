1 Protests have erupted across the United States following the death of an unarmed black man in police custody. George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on the man&#39;s neck, suffocating him to death. Floyd&#39;s death, the latest in a line of killings of African-Americans by law enforcement officers in the US, has reawakened deep anger at generations of black people who have fallen victim to police brutality - and rekindled a centuries-long struggle for racial justice in America.

**What is Black Lives Matter?**

2 The latest deaths have led to a resurgence in the &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; movement, founded in 2013, initially as a social media hashtag before becoming a protest movement, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin, the previous year.

3 According to their website, the BLM mission is to &quot;eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes. By combating and countering acts of violence, creating space for Black imagination and innovation, and centering Black joy, we are winning immediate improvements in our lives.&quot;

**When Did the Protests Start?**

4 Protests began on May 27 in Minneapolis and have quickly spread to several cities across the US, including New York, Washington DC and Los Angeles.

5 Protests were largely peaceful but became more violent as police have clashed with demonstrators, looters and journalists. The police have faced widespread criticism for heavy-handed tactics.

6 Thousands have now turned out for protests across Asia, Australia and Europe.

**How Has Donald Trump Responded?**

7 The US president has been accused of inciting racial hatred on a number of occasions and his response to the protests was to threaten violence. &quot;Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,&quot; Mr. Trump said, in a comment interpreted by some as a warning that police could open fire.

8 The tweet was covered from view by a message from Twitter which explained its contents &quot;violated the Twitter rules about glorifying violence&quot;, which started a row between the president and the social media giant.

9 On May 30, Mr. Trump warned protesters outside the White House that they would be met with &quot;vicious dogs&quot; if they scaled the fence as violent demonstrations broke out in Washington. On the previous night, Secret Service agents rushed Mr. Trump to a bunker as protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades.

10 On June 1, Mr. Trump threatened to mobilise the military across the US, said he was deploying thousands of &quot;heavily armed&quot; soldiers in Washington, and declared himself the &quot;president of law and order&quot;.

11 In extraordinary scenes, Mr. Trump made the declaration in the White House Rose Garden as riot police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and horses to clear peaceful protesters outside.
